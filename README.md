# WpfMergingXamlResources

This project includes a small program that merges Xaml resource dictionaries into a single XAML file.
It also inlcudes a WPF solution that demonstrates how the Xaml merger should be used.

Open the solution located in MainApp\WpfResourceDictionaryMerger.sln, build the solution and run the program.
If opening MainWindow.xaml you can see the designer works perfectly with all the resources.
